Here are a couple of challenges to try on your own.

Reset the unmatched cards by clicking any card. This involves making a new action handler in Card.js and assigning it to the Card component click in a specific scenario.

In index.css there is a ‘no-match’ selector which makes text red and can be applied to the card style when two visible cards are not matching. The challenge here is to apply the style to the text of cards that are flipped over and not matched.
